# TalkBox

The goal of the TalkBox project is to develop an open-source, open-hardware Speech Generating Device (aka "SGD"). The project has been undertaken by faculty and students from the GaMaY Lab, in the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University, in collaboration with community partners.

Please see [here](http://tkunic.github.io/TalkBox) for setup instructions and details.

The `mpr121.py` file is derived from Scott Garner's [Beetbox](http://scott.j38.net/interactive/beetbox/) project, which is in turn based on [an Arduino example by Jim Lindblom](http://bildr.org/2011/05/mpr121_arduino/). The old TalkBox repo can be found [here](https://github.com/hrairhlessil/TalkBox).

## Build one!

You'll need the following materials:

- [MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9695).
- [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).
- Some header pins and wires.
- A small speaker.
- As many arts and crafts materials as you like!
